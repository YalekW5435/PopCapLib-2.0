A much requested version of PopCap's old SexyAppBase framework that instead using outdated old framework code,
it combines code from the framework and wraps it around SFML.  
This was done because the older version used old legacy drawing methods, that were not open to the public.  
This will also make this library a lot more platform independent, therefore making it cross-platform with no problem.
This will also port the library to modern gaming and operating systems.  

This library is still under development, no release date has been scheduled.  The library is released under the MIT license.

WINDOWS/VISUAL STUDIO:
The cmake stuff will automatically fetch the necessary files from the SFML repositories. It is set in an \external\ folder.
