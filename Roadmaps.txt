This file is a checklist of what we will be adding in the future.
**= is checked off, while x is future features.**

*Stuff already made:*
= an example and familiar main.cpp
= a graphics set of files that uses some of what SFML already uses to draw lines, shapes, etc.
includes some vector functions.
= The core of the library (in Base.h and cpp).

Stuff that is in the plans:

x introduce the widgets classes, and implement them on SFMLs drawing code...
x expand upon graphics, adding 3D vectors, transformations, etc.
x add animations from 2D strips, and other types of animations.
x enable some sort of use with an ImageFont, but in the PopLib::Font, and in use with sf::Font classes instead.

x Add a custom implementation of the Todd Foley Library, which was used in later versions of the older SexyApp 
library not accessible to the public.

x Add error handling functionality.
x Add a resource/assets manager.
x add file io handling.
x add image functionality.
