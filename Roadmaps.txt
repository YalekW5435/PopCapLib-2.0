This file is a checklist of what we will be adding in the future.
**= is checked off, while x is future features.**

**Stuff already made:**
= an example and familiar main.cpp
= a graphics set of files that uses some of what SFML already uses to draw lines, shapes, etc.
includes some vector functions.
= The core of the library (in Base.h and cpp).
= Add a resource/assets manager.
= add image functionality.

**Stuff that is in the plans:**

x expand upon graphics, adding 3D vectors, transformations, etc.
x add animations from 2D strips, and other types of animations.

x Add a custom implementation of the Todd Foley Library, which was used in later versions of the older SexyApp 
library not accessible to the public.

x Add a customized variant of PopPak.  This was used in making maina.pak files seen in earlier games.
x Add error handling functionality.
